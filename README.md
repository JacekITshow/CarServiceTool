Just Notes for CST (Car Service Tool)

Its sample project ot learn about fullstack technology with spring-boot and react. Its single .war file with backend spring-boot and frontend react+typescript to deploy it for server.

In config I also add sample config for run it in IBM webSphere Liberty.

React check is it runned from IDE or from the server and connect with specific port (lets check GenericHttp.ts)
